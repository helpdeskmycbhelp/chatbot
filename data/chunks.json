Together, we can navigate the challenges of the digital age with vigilance and responsibility.\nLISTING POLICY\nZubair\n​\nFORM A is Mandatory:\nIt is mandatory to have FORM A signed by the seller in order to list their property. This is a strict policy enforced by RERA. If a client is unwilling to cooperate, the agent can share the circular explaining that this is not our requirement, but an official requirement by RERA. FORM A can be generated through the Dubai Rest App.\nPrice Range:",
  "The agent is not authorized to change the price in the listing. If there is a price change, the price must be amended in FORM A, and the updated form must be signed by the seller/landlord.\nNOC instead of Form A:\nSome agents are submitting an NOC as a confirmation to list the property as the Seller doesn't want to sign Form A. This is not acceptable. For any listing of an individual owner, NOC will not be accepted, and they need to have a Form A signed. NOC can only be allowed for Developer's listings. NOC from Developer will only be accepted if the agreement with the Developer is valid.\nPeriod of Expiry on Form A:\nThe Form A can have a maximum validity period of 1 year. During this period, as specified in the Form A, the agent is allowed to list the property. After the expiry of this period, a new Form A must be submitted. Additionally, every listing form should include an expiry period and cannot be open-dated. Please note that some portals do not accept Form A with a validity of more than 6 months; even if the form is still valid, these portals may take the listings offline.\nFor rental listings, owners not willing to sign or share documents with signature:",
  "It is mandatory to obtain some ID proof which has their signature to proceed with publishing their listing.\nPOA of POA:\nThe direct POA of the Seller can sign the Form A but the POA of a POA cannot sign it.\nDraft of:\nA) Fresh/New listing: If \"Agent A\" creates a DRAFT of a fresh listing without sufficient documents, he/she can work on the particular listing but if \"Agent B\" is able to get all documents of that particular listing along with the FORM A (signed by actual owner) then the listing will belong to \"Agent B\" and the listing will be transferred on the CRM from \"Agent A' to \"Agent B\" without any notification.\nB) Expired listing: If \"Agent A\" has a published listing that’s expiring soon or has expired, the agent needs to extend the Form A validity. If the Form A for a previously published listing, is signed by a new agent after the expiry, the listing will belong to the new agent.\nPriority to internal source:",
  "If any agent has an inquiry of a Seller/Landlord or Buyer/Tenant they have to FIRST check within the company and see if they are able to close the transaction within the company. Agent is allowed to deal with outside agents only if they were not able to meet the inquiry of their client within the company. This will be strictly monitored, and the commission will be blocked if the agent failed to enquire internally and decided to close with external agent.\nList before Action:\nThe company will only recognize agents with a valid Form A for the commission share.\nFalse Information on listing:",
  "The information mentioned on the published listing should match the information mentioned on the Form A/Listing form and Title Deed. If any agent tries to create a listing with false information they will be penalized financially. For instance, an Agent might add special characters (\",\" or \".\" etc) to list a unit because the unit is actually listed by another agent. Even if agent wishes to EDIT an existing listing, they cannot change/manipulate the information for the sake of listing a unit as per their convenience. The information should not be different than the listing form/Title Deed (price, unit #, build area, number of bedrooms etc) for editing any existing listing. Refer to Code of Ethics.\nIt is mandatory to mention correct information on the listing form including correct name of the Seller/Landlord as per Title deed, correct contact number of the Seller/Landlord. Any wrong or false information on the listing form will lead to strict action against the agent\nCommercial Listings of Individual owners:",
  "Most of the commercial buildings (retails and office spaces) might have a single owner for which they provide an NOC for the whole building instead of Listing Form for a particular unit. Therefore, if any agent has an inquiry for commercial properties, it should be directed to commercial team. If an agent wishes to check the availability of a commercial property, they should enter the name of the building so that the system can notify them on which commercial agent (if any) is working on that building. If there is no listing of a particular building in the system, then the agent may contact the landlord directly and proceed with transaction.\nGolden Rule: Anyone with Form A/valid leasing form supersedes all scenarios.\nLISTING GUIDELINES\nZubair\n​\nIt is very important to maintain the quality of listings on all the portals in order to get more attention from the clients. Below are few tips which are useful in order to achieve maximum quality in your listings:\nListing Title\nTitle of any listing is the most prominent text that features at the top of the listing. Be sure to mention key attributes, such as ‘price reduction’, ‘sea view’, ‘fully upgraded’ to attract quality leads.",
  "Keep in mind that your listing title can be between 30 and 50 characters maximum. Use this space wisely to really capture the property seekers. To ensure you get maximum Quality Score points for your title, stay within the character range.\nListing Price\nThe price mentioned on the listing should always match the price mentioned on the Form A / Listing Form approved by the Seller / Landlord.\nAccording to RERA it is considered as Legal offence if the price on the listing is not matching with the price on the document, otherwise you will be liable to face any consequences including the penalty from RERA which can go up to AED 50,000 or higher.\nListing Description\nAround 50% of visitors click ‘read more’ on the property details page. This offers a huge opportunity for you to ‘sell’ your listing to browsers by providing a detailed description of the property, noting all essential and stand-out features. For commercial listings, specify the necessary trade license relevant to the property’s location. For instance, a property located in JLT requires a DMCC License.",
  "Your Listing Description may range from 1000 to 2,000 characters. A strong description will also make your listing more discoverable to the user as the keyword search feature for most of the portals pulls from this section. Be sure to mention unique attributes such as the view, private swimming pool, fully landscaped garden, or proximity to key amenities, such as schools or supermarkets. To earn full Quality Score points, ensure you stay within the range.\nResponsibilities of Listing Agent\nListing agent is responsible to maintain the below checklist once received from the Landlord/Seller and provide the “Key receipt” of the same to the Landlord/Seller with his/her signature and upload the scanned copy of the receipt on Salesforce (CRM).\nThe agent is completely responsible for maintaining the property in proper condition. The property including any facilities of the building / unit / community cannot be used for any personal use at any circumstances. Strict action will be taken against an agent if the property is misused in any manner.",
  "The keys of the property at all times should be with the listing agent and cannot be given to anyone else to access to property (not even security staff). The agent should not leave the unit open at any circumstances and should be physically present for all viewings.\nListing Images\nYou must have heard of a saying that “a picture speaks a thousand words”. With that in mind, uploading high-quality images with your listing is hugely powerful. Approximately 70% of property seekers interact with images when they reach the property detail page. On top of that, Property Finder analysis shows that listings with high-quality images yield on average 30% more clicks and 50% more leads – so, your images are a chance for your listing to shine and stand out from the crowd!\nThe elements which a portal considers when it comes to quality are orientation, brightness, uniqueness and resolution.\nImage orientation\nLandscape photos, please! Use the space in the search results and property listing page to its maximum potential. We all know prime real estate is expensive, so why waste space!?\nImage brightness",
  "Make sure your images feature ample natural light to showcase the property the best way possible. Shoot during the day and invest in professional equipment – it pays off, we promise!\nImage uniqueness\nUpload unique content to promote your listing. Duplicate images don’t provide a good user experience. Most of the portals have measures in place to identify duplicate or spam content.\nImage resolution\nProviding high-resolution, clear images supports the consumer experience and showcases your listings in the best way.
